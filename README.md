# Obsidian Dataview Scripts
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) has this great plugin called [Dataiew](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview). This is a repository of various JavaScript scripts I run using Dataview.
## What is Dataview?
Dataview provides a JavaScript API and pipeline-based query language for filtering, sorting, and extracting data from Markdown pages.
## Try Youself
Read the requirements of the script, make required changes and then simply copy the scripts contents in a dataviewjs code block. I.e

<pre>
```dataviewjs
Paste JavaScript Code
```</pre>

## Scripts
### HomeNoteDisplayDailyNote.js
This script is used to display daily notes for the current and previous day along with a link to them. The daily note's file name should match the date in "YYYY-MM-DD" format. I use it to display my daily note along other important informations in my [home page note](https://github.com/mirnovov/obsidian-homepage)
